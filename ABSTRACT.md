**Google Recaptcha V2 Image** is a dataset for object detection and classification tasks. The dataset consists of 11730 images with 2584 labeled objects belonging to 3 different classes including *stair*, *crosswalk*, and *chimney*. The dataset contains 12 category: ***car***, ***other*** , ***crosswalk*** , ***bus***, ***hydrant***, ***palm***, ***traffic_light***, ***bicycle***, ***bridge***, ***stair***, ***chimney***, and ***motorcycle***. Google Recaptcha V2 Image dataset is a part of Recaptcha V2 Solve.

## Motivation 

Recaptcha V2 Solver is a Google Recaptcha V2 automated solution service. Many examples of Recaptcha V2 can be too difficult for a human to solve a captcha problem, it takes from time to time to complete it until the site makes sure that it is a real person. Our service will shift the responsibility for passing the captcha to artificial intelligence, while you drink coffee and use something more important.

During the study of repeated solutions, many tools were found that solve Recaptcha V2 by sound [(one of them)](https://github.com/dessant/buster). Much to my surprise, during the operation, we did not find a single implementation that would solve Recaptcha V2 from pictures. We were presented with an interesting solution for the implementation of Recaptcha, about getting images.
