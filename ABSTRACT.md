The **Google Recaptcha V2 Image** dataset is tailored for object detection and classification assignments. Comprising 11,730 images with 2,584 labeled objects falling into three distinct classes — *stair*, *crosswalk*, and *chimney* — this dataset features a range of 12 categories, including ***car***, ***other***, ***crosswalk***, ***bus***, ***hydrant***, ***palm***, ***traffic_light***, ***bicycle***, ***bridge***, ***stair***, ***chimney***, and ***motorcycle***. Forming a segment of Recaptcha V2 Solve, this dataset offers a diverse array of images designed to facilitate tasks in object detection and classification.

## Motivation 

Recaptcha V2 Solver is a Google Recaptcha V2 automated solution service. Many examples of Recaptcha V2 can be too difficult for a human to solve a captcha problem, it takes from time to time to complete it until the site makes sure that it is a real person. Authors' service will shift the responsibility for passing the captcha to artificial intelligence, while you drink coffee and use something more important.

During the study of repeated solutions, many tools were found that solve Recaptcha V2 by sound [(one of them)](https://github.com/dessant/buster). Much to my surprise, during the operation, authors did not find a single implementation that would solve Recaptcha V2 from pictures. Authors were presented with an interesting solution for the implementation of Recaptcha, about getting images.
